1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,010
Miyazaki stands radiantly
in the beauty of the desert.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,180
But what's that?

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,250
An odd figure appears from beyond the dunes.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,550
Some weirdo is coming this way.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,910
Isn't that person coming
straight toward Miyazaki?

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,280
A ransom kidnapper? Perhaps, a
robber? An anti-government guerrilla?

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,610
Hold on. He looks Japanese.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,010
Anno?

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,310
What in the world.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,410
Yes, it's the director of Evangelion, Anno.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,810
Two popular movies were released last summer alongside Princess Mononoke.

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,380
On top of working with Miyazaki on
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,610
the two have a good mentor/pupil relationship.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,180
Alright, who did this?

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,150
What is Anno doing in the Sahara desert?

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,780
The answer is the producer
Suzuki wanted to scare Miyazaki.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,880
However, he won't get mad just from being tricked.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,980
This kind of fooling around
might spur Ghibli's imagination.

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,810
With that...

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,550
Are we good to go?

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,510
If we talk here we'll only
scratch surface level topics.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,980
Towering east of the Sahara
Desert are the Atlas Mountains.

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,050
In the city's luxury hotel grows a lush background of

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,050
greenery unimaginable
against its desert surroundings.

25
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,680
Here, the world's most
prided directors sit down to talk.

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,950
First, a word about each other's works.

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,780
I feel that your greatest
strength is being honest.

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,685
Like how you created Evangelion, an honest work.

29
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:00,380
You created something that didn't deviate from your personality.

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,110
What are your thoughts on Princess Mononoke?

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,950
I can't say that when he's right here.

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
Exactly. I'm not going to fix it.

33
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,110
When I'm working....I don't know what it
is, but I feel like all my troubles disappear.

34
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,110
I want to work.

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,480
I think I have the most fun
animating when I've hit my limit.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,850
Hitting your limit is no fun at all.

37
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,180
I enjoy it.

38
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,717
I feel alive when it's
down to the last stretch,

39
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,610
and there's uncertainty whether
it'll be finished in time or not.

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,350
I'm perfectly fine without that.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,010
After some sparse chitchat Miyazaki said this:

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,950
It's all luck. If you make it, they will come.

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,410
You can draw in the children and make them smile.

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,080
Whether they genuinely enjoy it is the real battle.

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,610
Don't underestimate this old man.

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,410
That'll bite them in the butt.

47
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,180
When I think about how I haven't
reached some people, I feel empty.

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,810
I have to start from square one and study,
ah but I don't want to. I just have to try.

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,180
Study and work towards putting a smile
on the faces of children everywhere.

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,450
Don't these sound like words from a
man that might retract his retirement?

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,210
After 3 years, Miyazaki completed
production on Princess Mononoke.

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,850
This trip to the Sahara with the staff and friends

53
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,310
was a way to rejuvenate after such a long process.

54
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:46,117
And inside the mind of the refreshed Miyazaki...
